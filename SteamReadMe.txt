[h1]Quasimorph Augment Indicator[/h1]


Adds an indicator to the Corpse Screen if the body contains an augment.
Currently this only searches for Human augments and implants due to the amount of junk Quasimorph augmentations on enemies.

The indicators are:
[list]
[*]The Body button will have a green border if there is an implant present.
[*]The Body button will have a yellow border if there are augments, but no implants.
[/list]
