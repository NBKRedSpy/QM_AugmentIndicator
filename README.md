# Quasimorph AugmentIndicator

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

Adds an indicator to the Corpse Screen if the body contains an augment.
Currently this only searches for Human augments and implants due to the amount of junk Quasimorph augmentations on enemies.

The indicators are:
* The name of the enemy will have a prefix.  A for Augment, I for implant.
* The Body button will have a yellow border.
